### Reporting a vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public GitHub issue.

Instead, report it privately:

- Email: **security@localhost** (replace with your preferred contact)

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability and impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible)
- Affected versions/commits
- Any mitigations you’re aware of

### Supported versions
This project does not currently maintain multiple supported release lines.
Security fixes will be applied to the default branch.

### Disclosure process
We aim to:
- Acknowledge your report within **7 days**
- Provide a remediation plan or patch as soon as practical
- Coordinate disclosure timing when appropriate
